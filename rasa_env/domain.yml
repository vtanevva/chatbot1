  utter_Cuts:
  - text: Wash the cut properly to prevent infection and stop the bleeding by applying
      pressure for 1-2minutes until bleeding stops. Apply Petroleum Jelly to make
      sure that the wound is moist for quick healing. Finally cover the cut with a
      sterile bandage. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen can be applied.
  utter_greeting:
  - text: Hi , i am your paramedic assistant
  utter_Abrasions:
  - text: "Begin with washed hands.Gently clean the area with cool to lukewarm water\
      \ and mild soap. Remove dirt or other particles from the wound using sterilized\
      \ tweezers.For a mild scrape that\xE2\u20AC\u2122s not bleeding, leave the wound\
      \ uncovered.If the wound is bleeding, use a clean cloth or bandage, and apply\
      \ gentle pressure to the area to stop any bleeding.Cover a wound that bled with\
      \ a thin layer of topical antibiotic ointment, like Bacitracin, or a sterile\
      \ moisture barrier ointment, like Aquaphor. Cover it with a clean bandage or\
      \ gauze. Gently clean the wound and change the ointment and bandage once per\
      \ day.Watch the area for signs of infection, like pain or redness and swelling.\
      \ See your doctor if you suspect infection."
  utter_stings:
  - text: Remove any stingers immediately. Some experts recommend scraping out the
      stinger with a credit card. Applying ice to the site may provide some mild relief.
      Apply ice for 20 minutes once every hour as needed. Wrap the ice in a towel
      or keep a cloth between the ice and skin to keep from freezing the skin. Taking
      an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or a nonsedating one such
      as loratadine (Claritin) will help with itching and swelling. Take acetaminophen
      (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin)for pain relief as needed. Wash the sting site
      with soap and water. Placing hydrocortisone cream on the sting can help relieve
      redness, itching, and swelling.
  utter_Splinter:
  - text: 1. SOAK IT IN EPSOM SALTS. Dissolve a cup of the salts into a warm bath
      and soak whatever part of the body has the splinter. Failing that, you can also
      put some of the salts onto a bandage pad and leave it covered for a day; this
      will eventually help bring the splinter to the surface. 2. VINEGAR OR OIL. Another
      simple way to draw out that stubborn splinter is to soak the affected area in
      oil (olive or corn) or white vinegar. Just pour some in a bowl and soak the
      area for around 20 to 30 minutes,
  utter_Sprains:
  - text: "Use an ice pack or ice slush bath immediately for 15 to 20 minutes and\
      \ repeat every two to three hours while you're awake. To help stop swelling,\
      \ compress the ankle with an elastic bandage until the swelling stops. In most\
      \ cases, pain relievers \xE2\u20AC\u201D such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB,\
      \ others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others)\
      \ are enough to manage the pain of a sprained ankle."
  utter_Strains:
  - text: "Rest,Ice,Compression and Elevation can be used to cure strains. Avoid using\
      \ your muscle for a few days, especially if movement causes an increase in pain\
      \ and also Apply ice immediately after injuring your muscle. This will minimize\
      \ swelling. Don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t put ice directly on your skin. Use an ice pack\
      \ or wrap ice in a towel. To reduce swelling, wrap the affected area with an\
      \ elastic bandage until swelling comes down."

      cloth or some other material. 4)Treat for shock. If the person feels faint or
      is breathing in short, rapid breaths, lay the person down with the head slightly
      lower than the trunk and, if possible, elevate the legs.
